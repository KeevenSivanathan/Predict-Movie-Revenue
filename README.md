# Predict-Movie-Revenue

Using a dataset containing information about 45,000 movies compiled from MovieLens, I predicted the revenue of a movie based on features such as movie budget, genre of film, 
and if it is a franchise film.  

After performing an extensive EDA on the dataset, I used 3 different Regression algorithms in order to predict the film revenue to find the model with the best predictice accuracy. 

1. Linear Regression
2. GradientBoosting Regression
3. XGBoost Regression
